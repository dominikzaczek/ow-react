# Simple properties table with display (React)
A tech assessment from Orbital Witness.

## Getting Started
1. Use `git clone` to clone the repository. 
2. Enter the directory and install npm modules with `npm install`
3. To start the application, use `npm run start` 
4. To check all the tests, please use `npm run test`

*I used my privately generated API key for Google maps so please use with moderation.*

## Features
The app is divided into two main parts - the table and the property details.

### Table
1. The table has a sorting feature (you can sort by property titles)
2. The control buttons appear when needed
3. You can control how many rows you want to display

### Property details
1. The app uses deep linking in case someone wants to share a specific property with other people
2. If there is no property with corresponding title number provided in the url params, 404 component will be returned instead

## Improvements
I decided to cap the time allocated to this task (180 minutes) to give you a realistic view of my skills. There are certain things that I would like to improve - I am happy to discuss that if you would be interested in having a follow-up call.

## Afterword
Thank you for giving me a chance to show my skills. I hope to hear back from you soon.
